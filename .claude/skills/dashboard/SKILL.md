# Dashboard Skill

## Scope

Use this skill for files under:

- `apps/dashboard/`

## MVP Requirements

The dashboard should support:

- component list
- trace list by component
- input / output / error / duration display
- policy mode display
- policy mode update
- shadow comparison display
- manual evaluation: better / worse / same / unsure

## Rules

- Prefer clarity over visual polish in MVP.
- Make component_id visible.
- Make current output and candidate output easy to compare.
- Do not expose replace mode controls in MVP unless explicitly added later.
- Show server/API errors clearly.

## Verification

For UI-only changes, provide manual verification steps if automated tests are not available.
